## Wondering how much clothing you need to wear before walking out of the building?

Students at UCL EAST (including my group members and I) experience this situation quite often: because the classroom is heated or air-conditioned, a fairly comfortable office environment is maintained, resulting in a sudden cold wind that freezes you into a popsicle or a sun that is about to melt you when you go out. To solve this problem, our group designed a dial that displays the outdoor body temperature as a reminder to dress and undress.
